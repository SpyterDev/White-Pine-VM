# About White Pine VM
White Pine is a Work-In-Progress 32-bit basic and simple virtual machine written in the C programming language.
The White Pine instruction set is similar to ARMv7, in fact, the instruction set was based on ARM (and most
instructions will probably be the same or similar)! Even though White Pine is a 32-bit *virtual machine, each 
instruction is 8 bytes long (or 64-bits), and is basically just a modified version of how 32-bit ARM is encoded 
(but extended to 64-bits). As of now, there is unfounately 10 used bits in a instruction however they can (and might)
be used in the future. White Pine is early in its development and more instructions will be added and implemented,
everything is Subject-To-Change.

# Why does this exist?
White Pine is a project I am working on to learn how to make my own virtual machine (basically from scratch)
and for fun. 

# Just for fun!

### Why is the Virtual Machine called "White Pine"?
I prefer naming my projects after trees because I am not great at coming up with names. It also sounds pretty cool!
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
